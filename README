Padding Oracle
==============

A Demostration of Vaudenay's CBC padding oracle attack [1]. This follows the original paper quite closely, and to understand the code, reading the paper might be useful. More documentation forthcoming.

Installation
============

Clone this repository and run

    $ go build

Use

    $ ./padding-oracle ["optional example string"]

More illustrative GUI visualising the decryption process might be forthcoming.
